This is an OpenSourced Custom kernel Source code for the Wiko DarkMoon  (MEDIATEK MT6582)
As you know, Wiko, never released the proper buildable kernel sources for this device

Linux 3.4.5


Building the Kernel:
********************
cd to kernel dir
********************

- Run script "./build.sh darkmoon" to begin with the build process.

- Run script "./build.sh clean darkmoon" to clean the project


  Once finished, you will find:
  - The new kernel file in the root folder ./build_result/kernel/        --> zImage
  - The new compiled modules in the root folder ./build_result/modules/  --> *.ko
